## [Chemical Incident Response Platform Simulation (ChIRPS)](/projects/Chemical-Incident-Simulation)
This project is a web-based simulation and training platform designed to model complex chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) emergency response scenarios. The system enables facilitators to run realistic, multi-agency incident exercises while capturing detailed, time-ordered decision-making and operational actions.

The platform is intended to support:

  * Emergency management training
  * Multi-agency coordination exercises
  * After Action Reports (AAR)
  * Decision analysis and replay
  * Auditability and compliance-oriented recordkeeping


## [ERES: Emergency Response & Evaluation System](/projects/Emergency-Response-Evaluation-System)
In Emergency Management, Emergency Operations Plans (EOPs) are critical but cumbersome. Often spanning hundreds of pages, these PDFs are difficult to navigate under the high-stress conditions of an active incident.

ERES is a local-first, high-performance RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline designed to ingest complex EOPs and provide instant, grounded answers to field responders.
