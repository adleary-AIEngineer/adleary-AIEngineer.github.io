# AI Systems and Cloud Architecture Portfolio

I am a project and program management professional in emergency management, focused on chemical and biological threats, who is transitioning into AI systems and cloud architecture. This site documents my work designing and building end-to-end AI-enabled platforms, with an emphasis on system architecture, reliability, and operational readiness.

My focus is on how AI, data platforms, and cloud infrastructure fit together to form production-grade systems — not just isolated models or prototypes.

## Areas of Focus

- AI system architecture and platform design
- LLM-enabled application and workflow design
- Backend service and API architecture
- Data platform design (document + relational systems)
- Cloud-native architecture on AWS
- Observability, reliability, and operational considerations

## Flagship Work (In Progress)

### Chemical Incident Response Platform Simulation (ChIRPS)
This project is a web-based simulation and training platform designed to model complex chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) emergency response scenarios. The system enables facilitators to run realistic, multi-agency incident exercises while capturing detailed, time-ordered decision-making and operational actions.

The platform is intended to support:

- Emergency management training
- Multi-agency coordination exercises
- After Action Reports (AAR)
- Decision analysis and replay
- Auditability and compliance-oriented recordkeeping

### ERES: Emergency Response & Evaluation System
In Emergency Management, Emergency Operations Plans (EOPs) are critical but cumbersome. Often spanning hundreds of pages, these PDFs are difficult to navigate under the high-stress conditions of an active incident.

ERES is a local-first, high-performance RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline designed to ingest complex EOPs and provide instant, grounded answers to field responders.

## How to Use This Site

This portfolio is structured to support different levels of depth:

- Start here for a high-level overview
- Visit Projects for platform and system case studies
- Explore Architecture for detailed system designs and tradeoff discussions

Together, these materials reflect my approach to designing AI-enabled systems that can be deployed, operated, and evolved in real-world environments.
