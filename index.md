# AI Systems and Cloud Architecture Portfolio

I am a project and program management professional in emergency management, focused on chemical and biological threats, who is transitioning into AI systems and cloud architecture. This site documents my work designing and building end-to-end AI-enabled platforms, with an emphasis on system architecture, reliability, and operational readiness.

My focus is on how AI, data platforms, and cloud infrastructure fit together to form production-grade systems — not just isolated models or prototypes.

## Areas of Focus

- AI system architecture and platform design
- LLM-enabled application and workflow design
- Backend service and API architecture
- Data platform design (document + relational systems)
- Cloud-native architecture on AWS
- Observability, reliability, and operational considerations

        ## Flagship Work (In Progress)
        
        ### LLM-Powered Resume Builder Platform
        An end-to-end AI-enabled platform combining LLM services, backend APIs, and persistent data storage.  
        Focus areas: LLM orchestration, API design, data modeling, and system architecture.

        ### Cloud & Data Platform Architecture
        A cloud-native platform design focused on data ingestion, storage, and analysis to support AI-enabled applications.  
        Focus areas: AWS architecture, data pipelines, and platform-level design.

## How to Use This Site

This portfolio is structured to support different levels of depth:

- Start here for a high-level overview
- Visit Projects for platform and system case studies
- Explore Architecture for detailed system designs and tradeoff discussions

Together, these materials reflect my approach to designing AI-enabled systems that can be deployed, operated, and evolved in real-world environments.
