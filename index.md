## Building AI Systems for High-Stakes Environments

I'm a project and program management professional transitioning from **20+ years in emergency management and CBRN operations** into **AI systems architecture and cloud platform design**.

This portfolio documents my journey building production-oriented AI platforms — systems designed not just to work in demos, but to operate reliably under real-world constraints.

---

## What Makes This Portfolio Different

My approach to AI engineering is shaped by decades of leading complex, high-stakes programs where failure has consequences. I don't just build models — I design the **full platforms** that support them:

- **End-to-end system architecture** — from data pipelines to service layers to deployment
- **Operational readiness** — reliability, monitoring, failure modes, and recovery
- **Real-world constraints** — security, scalability, maintainability, and cost tradeoffs

##  Technical Focus Areas

| **AI & LLM Systems** | **Platform & Infrastructure** |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| • LLM application architecture | • Backend service architecture |
| • RAG system design | • API design for AI workflows |
| • Multi-step orchestration | • Cloud-native AWS systems |
| • Model evaluation & monitoring | • Data platform design |


**Core Technologies:** Python • SQL • MongoDB • AWS • Git • CI/CD

## Featured Projects

### 🚨 [ChIRPS: Chemical Incident Response Platform Simulation](/projects/Chemical-Incident-Simulation)

A web-based training platform for multi-agency CBRN emergency response exercises.

**The Challenge:** Traditional tabletop exercises lack auditability, time-ordering, and realistic multi-agency coordination dynamics.

**The System:** Full-stack platform enabling facilitators to run realistic incident simulations while capturing every decision, action, and communication in a queryable, time-ordered format.

**Architecture Focus:**

- Multi-user real-time coordination workflows
- Event-sourced data model for replay and analysis
- Role-based access and agency separation
- Automated After Action Report generation

---

### 📋 [ERES: Emergency Response & Evaluation System](/projects/Emergency-Response-Evaluation-System)

A local-first RAG pipeline that makes 500+ page Emergency Operations Plans instantly searchable during active incidents.

**The Problem:** Critical guidance is buried in massive PDFs, making it nearly impossible to find what you need when seconds count.

**The Solution:** High-performance retrieval system delivering grounded, source-cited answers to field responders.

**Architecture Focus:**

- Document chunking and embedding strategies
- Hybrid retrieval (vector + keyword)
- Citation and source attribution
- Local-first design for network-degraded environments

## Why I'm Building in Public

I'm documenting this transition to:

1. **Demonstrate technical growth** through hands-on system design
2. **Show architectural thinking** — not just code, but design decisions and tradeoffs
3. **Build credibility** in AI engineering through real, deployable systems
4. **Connect with others** working at the intersection of AI and complex operational domains
