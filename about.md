# About
I design and lead the development of AI-enabled systems for complex, high-stakes operational environments.

I am an action-oriented project and program management professional in emergency management, with a focus on chemical and biological threats. I bring over 20 years of experience delivering results at the intersection of policy, planning, and operations, with a proven record of:
   * Standing up and scaling national-level chemical preparedness and response programs.
   * Driving complex interagency initiatives from concept through implementation.
   * Leading crisis action planning for pandemics, major hurricanes, wildfires, and CBRN.

This experience informs how I now approach complex technical systems: as mission-critical platforms that must operate under real-world constraints.

I bring a multidisciplinary perspective spanning biotechnology, emergency and disaster management, military CBRN and civilian HAZMAT operations, medical countermeasures policy and requirements, and federal program/portfolio management. Not a single-domain specialist, but a practitioner who tackles problems from multiple angles and gets things done. That same multidisciplinary, execution-focused mindset now guides how I am building capability in AI systems and cloud architecture.

In parallel, I am developing hands-on skills in AI systems and cloud architecture, with the goal of designing and guiding the development of production-grade AI platforms and decision-support systems.

My background in leading complex, high-stakes programs shapes how I approach technology: I think in terms of systems, architecture, and operational realities. As I expand into more technical work, I focus on how AI, data platforms, and cloud infrastructure fit together to form reliable, maintainable, and scalable systems.

Rather than positioning myself purely as an individual contributor engineer, I am intentionally building toward roles that combine technical depth with system architecture, platform design, and technical leadership responsibility. My focus is on understanding how to design AI-enabled platforms end-to-end — from service boundaries and data flows to deployment models, observability, and lifecycle management.

## What I’m Building Capability In

### AI & LLM Systems
- Designing end-to-end LLM application architectures
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system design
- Multi-step LLM orchestration and workflow design
- Evaluation strategies and monitoring of model behavior
- Responsible integration of LLMs into operational systems

### Backend Platforms & APIs
- Service-oriented backend architecture
- API design for AI-driven platforms
- Async workflows and background processing models
- Logging, monitoring, and system observability

### Data Platforms
- Data modeling for AI-enabled applications
- MongoDB for document and workflow persistence
- SQL for structured data and analytics
- Schema and versioning strategies for evolving systems

### Cloud & Infrastructure Architecture
- Cloud-native system design on AWS
- Compute, storage, and networking architecture
- Environment separation (dev/staging/prod)
- Security, scalability, and cost considerations
- Deployment and operational architecture patterns

### Languages & Tools (for architectural depth)
- Python
- SQL
- Git and collaborative workflows
- Testing frameworks
- CI/CD pipelines

## Architectural & Systems Perspective

My work in emergency management and chemical and biological threat domains requires disciplined systems thinking, risk awareness, and operational planning. I bring that same mindset into technical architecture:

- Designing for failure modes and recovery
- Making architectural tradeoffs explicit
- Prioritizing reliability and clarity over unnecessary complexity
- Ensuring systems can be operated, monitored, and evolved over time

This perspective informs how I approach AI and cloud architecture, particularly in environments where safety, accountability, and resilience matter.

## Why AI Systems and Cloud Architecture

I am focused on AI systems and cloud architecture because they enable scalable decision support, automation, and data-driven capabilities in complex operational environments. My interest is not limited to building models, but in designing the full platforms that support them — including data pipelines, service layers, and operational tooling.

## What You’ll Find on This Site

This site documents my transition through system designs, hands-on projects, and architectural writeups. You will find:

- AI and LLM system architecture designs
- Cloud and data platform architectures
- Project case studies focused on system design
- Engineering and architecture notes with explicit tradeoffs

These materials reflect both my technical growth and my focus on building systems that are suitable for real-world deployment.

If you are interested in AI system architecture, cloud platform design, or applying these technologies in complex operational domains, I welcome the opportunity to connect.
