title: Leadership
---
I have had the honor to lead small teams over my career. Whether a team of direct reports, a cross-matrixed project team, or leading across and up without authority, my values remain consistent. Cultivated throughout my lifetime, these values are how I approach my work and my life.

## Honor Dignity
I believe that every person possesses inherent worth. My leadership starts with honoring the dignity of my team, which goes beyond mere politeness. I commit to accepting you as you are, seeking to understand your lived experience, and protecting the ten elements of dignity in every interaction. I see our diversity of perspective and knowledge not just as an asset, but as a requirement for our collective success.

## Cultivate Character
I am a lifelong learner, and I expect us to grow together. While I value competence—the skills to do the job—I place equal weight on character. These "human skills" are the most difficult to master, often requiring us to unlearn a lifetime of conditioning. I believe a day is never wasted if we learn something new about ourselves, our craft, or each other.

## Empower People
My primary responsibilities are the accomplishment of the mission and the welfare of my team. These are not in competition; they are symbiotic. By adopting a facilitative leadership style, I work alongside you to uncover solutions and remove obstacles. When I take care of you, I trust you to take care of the mission.

## Embrace Vulnerability
I am human and I will make mistakes. When I fail, I will acknowledge it and apologize. I grant you the authority to call me out when I miss the mark, just as I will be thoughtful and considerate in providing feedback to you. I don’t seek "attaboys"—I seek the truth. I believe we cannot improve without the courage to be honest about where we stand.

## Fuel Curiosity
I ask questions to understand, never as a "gotcha." I use curiosity as the engine for our development, probing deeper into problems and perspectives to find the best path forward. By staying inquisitive about our work and each other, we transform challenges into opportunities for growth and ensure that our mission is driven by insight rather than assumption.
